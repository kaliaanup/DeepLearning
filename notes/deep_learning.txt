supervised
----------
Feed Forward Network

1. feed forward network also referred as MLP. It's a fully connected dense model used as a simple classifier.

2. convolution neural network assume that highly correlated features located to each other in the input matrix. 
   It can be pooled and treated as one in the next layer

Recurrent Neural Network

1. recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle

2. long short term memory network contains gates that determine if the input is significant enough to remember

Unsupervised
---------------

1. Auto encoder aims to learn representation for a set of data typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction

2. Restricted Boltzmann machine can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs

3. Deep Belief Net is a composition of simple unsupervised networks such as restricted Boltzmann machines where 
each sub-network's hidden layer serves as the visible layer for the next

Transfer learning
------------------
--It is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained 
while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem

--very people train CNN from scratch because it is rare to get enough dataset
--pre-trained network weights as initializations or a fixed feature extractor helps in solving most of the problems
--very deep networks are expensive to train
--determine topology/flavor/training method/hyper params
--most of the computer vision problems does not have large datasets 
--training networks with million parameters generally tend to overfit the model
--covnet features are more generic in early layers 
--more original-dataset-specific in latent layers
--So lets freeze all the VGG19 layers and train only the classifier
--for layer in model.layers:
   --layer.trainable = False
 
--New dataset is large and similar to the original dataset
